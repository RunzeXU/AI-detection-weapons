This is a collaborative project with a company called `Integrated` and` The Open University of Hong Kong`. The project aims to design an AI-based software function which can automatically detect and recognize firearms, knives, and other weapons in a streaming video captured by surveillance camera.

# Abstract
Security cameras and video surveillance systems have become important infrastructures for ensuring safety and security of the general public. However, the detection of high-risk situations through these systems are still performed manually in many cities. The lack of manpower in the security sector and limited performance of human may result in undetected dangers or delay in detecting threats, posing risks for the public. In response, various parties have developed real-time and automated solutions for identifying risks based on surveillance videos. The aim of this work is to develop a low-cost, efficient, and artificial intelligence-based solution for the real-time detection and recognition of weapons in surveillance videos under different scenarios. The system was developed based on Tensorflow and preliminarily tested with a 294-second video which showed 7 weapons within 5 categories, including `handgun`, `shotgun`, `automatic rifle`, `sniper rifle`, and `submachine gun`. At the `intersection over union (IoU)` value of `0.50` and `0.75`, the system achieved a precision of `0.8524` and `0.7006`, respectively.

# Introduction
At present, Artificial intelligence is no longer part of a strange new term. Not only the ALPHAGO but also the face scan payment technology, even drones, and driverless vehicles, the application of artificial intelligence gradually involves many aspects of our daily life. No doubt safety is one of the most important aspects of daily life and technology is becoming more mature. Nevertheless, today's mainstream security methods have been unable to meet the numerous security risks posed by technological development. The problem is that it is difficult to find a safe, effective, and low-cost way to ensure security.

So, Artificial intelligence will be used to improve this situation. In Hong Kong, the popularity rate of surveillance cameras is already high. There is a total of 24,591 surveillance cameras. This project plan through combining artificial intelligence with the existing surveillance cameras to automatically detect and recognize firearms, knives, and other weapons in a streaming video captured by a surveillance camera.
